# miniShell
practise 3 in Operative Systems. Please don't copy this code or use it as your own!

This is, simply put, a program emulating Shell in Linux. It will execute simple comands that can be found in Linux's native shell and exit when asked.
The Jobs function is implemented. It gets rid of zombie processes. Can execute several comands with the ";" delimiter.
